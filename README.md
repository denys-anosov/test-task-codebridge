# Project description
This is a React project where I used React hooks, Material UI library and React router.

The project fetches articles data from an open API and renders articles into cards on the home page.

Cards can be filtered by their title and summary through the input filter.

By clicking 'Read more' it takes user to a new page where the full summary of the article is rendered.
